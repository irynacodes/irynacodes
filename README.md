- 👋 Hi, I’m @irynacodes
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things :D My latest obsession (or a mere recycle of an old one) is reading. All sorts of different stuff. If you see me get on a tram without a book in my hand, then high chances are it's just someone with a similar haircut
- ☄ I’m currently learning how adult life works
- 📫 Reach me most reliably on Facebook – Ira Lazouskaya
- 🍃 Pronouns: she/her
- 🐦‍⬛ Fun fact: birds have iron-containing materials in their upper beaks – that's what helps them orient in space
