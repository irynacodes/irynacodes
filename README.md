# Hi 🌻

My name is Iryna and I sometimes code (hence @irynacodes – pretty straightforward). I enjoy coding fun things, and now that I have a github repo... I'll be unstoppable. Or at least I'll have somethiing to occupy myself when I'm not at school, work or out with friends.

I'm not a total beginner but I'm definitely not a pro either. I still have a lot to learn, and if I have fun along the way? I will not be complaining ☃️

<!---
irynacodes/irynacodes is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
